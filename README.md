Really bad Pong

Introducing really bad Pong game Programmed in Rust programming language using Bevy game engine!
!!Now with no scoreboard!!

Use W and S to move left paddle,
Up and Down to move right paddle.

Be careful not to get the ball stuck, though.

Also the speed is totally random, be ready for some REALLY slow games and others where you won't even be able to hit the ball.

I did what I could.
